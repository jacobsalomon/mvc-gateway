# MVC Gateway Architecture

## What This Repo Is

Think of the gateway as the front door and traffic cop for `mechanicalvisioncorp.com`.

It has two jobs:

1. Present the public-facing MVC story.
2. Route visitors to the right downstream app.

This repo should stay thin. It is not the product backend. It is not the investor deck app. It is the entry layer that makes the three-zone domain feel like one site.

## What This Repo Owns

- The landing page at `/`
- The print-first brief pages under `/brief`
- Domain canonicalization redirects
- Rewrites into MechaVision and the seed deck
- Shared marketing shell concerns like fonts, analytics, and page-level atmosphere

## What This Repo Does Not Own

- MechaVision authentication, dashboard, or APIs
- Seed deck application logic
- Product data, AI pipelines, or database access

If a change starts to look like business logic, it is probably in the wrong repo.

## Multi-Zone Model

The public domain is split across three Next.js projects:

```text
mechanicalvisioncorp.com
  /                -> mvc-gateway
  /brief/*         -> mvc-gateway
  /aerovision/*    -> aerovision-mvp
  /pitch/*         -> aerovision-seed-deck
```

The gateway is the piece that makes those boundaries invisible to the visitor.

## Routing Responsibilities

`next.config.ts` is the real control plane in this repo.

It owns:

- host redirects from `mechavisioncorp.com` and `mechanicalvision.ai` to `mechanicalvisioncorp.com`
- `beforeFiles` rewrites for `/aerovision` and `/pitch`

That means routing changes are infrastructure changes, even if they look like small text edits.

## Request Flow

```text
Visitor hits mechanicalvisioncorp.com
  -> host redirect check
  -> path check
     -> /aerovision/* rewrites to deployed MechaVision app
     -> /pitch/* rewrites to deployed seed deck app
     -> everything else is served by the gateway itself
```

The gateway currently rewrites to the deployed Vercel project URLs, so if those project targets change, `next.config.ts` must change with them.

## Directory Map

```

## Two Visual Surfaces

This repo actually contains two presentation modes.

### 1. Cinematic Landing Page

This is the homepage.

- dark, high-contrast, narrative-driven
- scroll pacing matters
- heavier interactive pieces are lazy-loaded below the fold
- CTAs move the visitor into the product or the pitch deck

### 2. Print-First Briefs

These are the `/brief` routes.

- fixed letter-size pages
- controlled density
- optimized for web viewing and print
- no indexing by search engines

Treat them like branded handouts, not like normal website pages.

## Runtime Behavior

Most of the repo is simple server-rendered marketing content. A few pieces are intentionally client-side:

- navbar scroll state
- animated background grid
- reveal-on-scroll sections
- the wasted-hours ticker
- the "What If" cinematic scroll sequence

Heavy motion is pushed below the fold or lazy-loaded so the hero renders fast.

## Deployment Constraints

- This repo must stay on **Next.js 15** to remain compatible with the multi-zone rewrite setup.
- The gateway itself does not depend on backend product secrets.
- Vercel auto-deploys from `main`.

Because the gateway is thin, changes here should usually be low-risk. The exception is routing. Rewrites and redirects can break the whole domain if they are wrong.

## Ownership Boundaries

Keep these lines sharp:

- Gateway owns public messaging and navigation into the system.
- MechaVision owns the actual product experience.
- Seed deck owns investor storytelling.

The gateway can point people into those experiences, but it should not start recreating them locally.

## Change Guardrails

- Keep routing logic centralized in `next.config.ts`.
- Keep the homepage focused on story and conversion, not feature sprawl.
- Keep `/brief` print-first. Do not turn it into a general CMS.
- When adding CTAs, point to the real downstream product surfaces instead of creating fake stand-ins here.
- Prefer lightweight interactions over heavy client-side complexity.
